# Biases in GDP Child Mortality rate Dashboard
## I have created this dashboard in Tableau for exploring the relationship between child mortality rate and national GDP for different countries in the world including High-Income, Low Income, Lower middle Income & Upper middle-income countries. Next, I estimated an expected GDP for each nation from population. Finally, I created a probability-probability (P-P) plot of expected GDP against actual GDP parameterized by child mortality rate. Clicking on a summary label below discover the biases. I have used the slider to adjust the year. This slider allows users to adjust the data displayed on the dashboard based on the year (from 2000 to 2017). This can be useful for tracking changes over time or focusing on specific periods of interest. I have also highlighted each nation which helps users to interact with the dashboard by clicking on the map or the P-P plot to highlight specific nations. This feature enables users to explore individual countries and their data more closely. The relationship between child mortality rate and GDP is a crucial aspect of understanding the socio-economic development of a country. Generally, as GDP increases, child mortality rates tend to decrease. It is clear from the P-P plot that the Low Income and Lower Middle-Income countries have higher child mortality rate compared to the High Income and Upper middle-income countries.
